NAME
    RDF::GraphStore - SPARQL 1.1 HTTP Bindings

VERSION
    Version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This module attempts to track the SPARQL 1.1. HTTP Bindings document,
    currently mostly as a discussion item.

    This first release contains the queries specified in the specification,
    but be warned that this is not the most efficient way to implement the
    specification, and is subject to change in later releases.

    The SPARQL 1.1 HTTP bindings document, which can be found at
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/> specifies how RDF
    graphs can be updated with using four HTTP verbs in a RESTful manner.
    This module is first and foremost intended as a discussion item
    implementation of the proposed protocol.

METHODS
  model
    The model we're working on.

  headers_in ( [ $headers ] )
    Returns the HTTP::Headers object if it exists or sets it if a
    HTTP::Headers object is given as parameter.

  response
    Returns the Plack::Response object if it exists

  clear_response
    Clears the Plack::Response object

  has_response
    Returns true if the "response" is initialized

  graph_uri ($uri)
    Returns the HTTP::Headers object if it exists or sets it if a
    HTTP::Headers object is given as parameter.

  has_graph_uri
    Returns true if the graph_uri has been set.

  init ( $headers, $graph_uri )
    A method to clear the response, set the headers and the graph URI. The
    graph URI may be either a URI object or a string.

  get_response
    What to do with a GET request. Takes a URI object or a simple string as
    argument. Returns a Plack::Response object.

  put_response
    What to do with a PUT request. Returns a Plack::Response object.

  post_response
    What to do with a POST request. Returns a Plack::Response object.

  delete_response
    What to do with a DELETE request. Returns a Plack::Response object.

  payload_model ( $request )
    Return a RDF::Trine::Model with the triples from the payload.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-rdf-query-httpbindings at rt.cpan.org", or through the web
    interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=RDF-Query-HTTPBindings>.
    I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of
    progress on your bug as I make changes.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
    The current implementation's main goal is to be close to the
    specification, and thus it contains the query strings as given in the
    specification. However, this is not the best way to implement this, as a
    pure RDF::Trine implementation is possible.

    Once the specification is finalized, the plan is to create a Moose::Role
    with a default implementation that does this the most efficient way, and
    leave the present implementation as an alternative implementation for
    demonstration purposes.
